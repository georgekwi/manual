\section{Import a basic Mule project into Anypoint Studio}
%%%%%%
\subsection{Import the starter project}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start Anypoint Studio
\item Create a new workspace
\item Import the \texttt{apdw2-flights-starter.jar} project under the \texttt{studentFiles/mod01}
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%
\subsection{Create new project}
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
\item Create a new project
  \newline
  \emph{
    Creating a new project and copying only the files you minimally need for the class helps in containing the ``noise'' that is introduced with starter project.  Additionally, there is the extra benefit of not having to deal with students who are having compilation issues with the starter project.
  }
\item Create a new project and call it dataweave
\item From the apdw2-flights-starter copy the following files over to the new project:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{/main/resources/airportInfoTiny.csv} to \texttt{src/main/resources}
  \item \texttt{src/main/resources/examples/mockdata/deltaSoapResponsesToAllDestinations.xml} to \texttt{src/test/resources}
  \item \texttt{src/test/resources/flight-example.json} to \texttt{src/test/resources}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Fundamentals review++}
\emph{
  In this WT the goal is to attempt (I am saying attempt because often enough we have participants who donâ€™t meet the prerequisites) to bring everyone at the same level by (1) reviewing fundamentals and (2) illustrating features of DW that we will be using throughout the class
}

\subsection{Create the flow, set the metadata}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rename the \texttt{dataweave.xml} to \texttt{mod1.xml}
\item Create a new flow named \texttt{mod1-review++}
  \newline
  \emph{
    The reason for prefixing the flow name with the name of the flow is a best-practice one.
    Such a convention will improve the readability of your flows by identifying the
    Mule Configuration file a flow is defined under by just looking at a Flow Reference's
    display name.
  }
\item Drop a DW (aka \texttt{Transform Message}) to the process area of the flow
\item Define the payload input metadata to the \texttt{src/test/resources/flight-example.json},
  set the name of the type to \texttt{flight\_json}
\item Edit the sample data
\item Turn on the preview
\item Change the output to JSON
\end{enumerate}
